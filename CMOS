COURSE AGENDA
-> History
	. Invention of tansistor(BJT) by Bell Laboratory in 1947 by Shockley,Brattain,Bardeen
	. First transistor IC in 1958 by Jack Kilby and that was an oscilloscope
	. Invention of CMOS logic gates 1963 by Wanlass & Sah- Fairchild semiconductor
	. First microprocessor(Intel 4004) 1970...2,300 MOS transistors,740 KHz clock frequency
	. VLSI in 1978(chips with >20,000 transistors)
	. ULSI 
	. SOC in 2002(20-30 million transistors)
	why VLSI
		. Before VLSI there are discrete circuits..we need to have components(capacitrs,resistors etc) seperately and connect all using wires
			it requires more area,wires increase propagation delay and power dissipation
			. In IC all the registors and capacitors are implemented using transistors and we don't require much wire etc
				. Higher speed, Lower power dissipation,Pysically smaller,low cost(almost no manual assembly)
	Application of VLSI	
		.Processors(CPU,DSP,Controllers)
		.Memory Chips(RAM,ROM,EEPROM)
		.Analog(Mobile communication,Audio/Video processing)
		.Programmable(PLA,FPGA)
		.Embedded systems(used in cars,factories,network cards)

	BJT:- a current controlled valve(current(base current IB) controlls collector current(IC)
	FET:- a voltage controlled value(voltage(gate-source Vgs) controlls the drain current(ID)

	. Bipolar(current is due to both majority and minority carriers) .Unipolar(current due to only majority carriers)
	. Current controlled device										. Voltage controlled device
	. Three terminals(Emitter,Base,Collector)						.Three terminals(Source,Gate,Drain)
	. Types: NPN,PNP												. types: PMOS,NMOS,CMOS,BiCMOS
	. switching speed is low and switching loss is more				. reverse
	. Low input Impedence and package density						. "
	. BJTs are preferred for low current applications				. high impedence caz of depletion region between gate and substrate
	. Hig gain
	
-> JFET(Junction Field Effect Transistor)	
-> MOSFET
. CMOS Fabrication
-> CMOS Characteristics
	. Drive large fan-out(no of output devices can be connected to output terminal)
	. High noise margin
	. Logic levels independent of device sizes
	. Always a path to Vdd or GND in steady state
	. low output impedance that why large fan_out
	. Less sensitive to noise
	. Exremely high input resistance(caz of oxide layer)..that's why it rejects noise
	. No direct path steady-state between power and ground

CMOS: complementary Metal OXide Semiconductor
	. NMOS
	. PMOS(p_type metal oxide semiconductor) Transistors
Vth : minimum voltage that must be applied to the gate terminal to induce a conduction channel.
-> NMOS(negatively doped for SRC and DRAIN regions) Transistor(Vth is positive)
	. conductor when applying Vdd to its gate
	. insulatory(gives better strong 0) when low is appied to its gate...that's why it's source terminal is connectd to GND
-> PMOS Transistor(Vth is negative..PMOS is turned on by applying a negative gate-source vlotage(when a more negative voltage is applied to the gate terminal ralive to the source))....bubble in symbol
	. conductor(gives better strong 1) when LOW is applied to its gate...that's why it's source terminal is connectd to VDD
	. insuator when Vdd is appied
	
-> CMOS inverter
